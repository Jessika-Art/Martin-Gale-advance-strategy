# Ctrl+C Fix for MartinGales Trading Bot

## Problem

When running the Streamlit application directly with `streamlit run app/ui/app.py`, pressing `Ctrl+C` would display "Stopping..." but the application would not terminate immediately. This is due to how Streamlit handles signal interrupts in its event loop.

## Solution

We've implemented a wrapper launcher script that properly handles signal interrupts and ensures immediate termination when `Ctrl+C` is pressed.

### Files Created

1. **`run_app.py`** - Python launcher script with proper signal handling
2. **`start_app.bat`** - Windows batch file for easy launching
3. **`start_app.sh`** - Unix/Linux shell script for easy launching

### How It Works

1. **Signal Handling**: The launcher script sets up proper signal handlers for `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C), `SIGTERM`, and on Windows, `SIGBREAK` (Ctrl+Break).

2. **Process Management**: Streamlit runs as a subprocess, allowing the parent process to monitor and control it.

3. **Graceful Shutdown**: When a signal is received:
   - The script immediately attempts to terminate the Streamlit process
   - Waits up to 3 seconds for graceful shutdown
   - If needed, force-kills the process
   - Exits cleanly

### Usage

#### Windows
```bash
# Option 1: Double-click the batch file
start_app.bat

# Option 2: Run from command line
start_app.bat

# Option 3: Run Python script directly
python run_app.py
```

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Option 1: Run the shell script
./start_app.sh

# Option 2: Run Python script directly
python run_app.py
```

### Benefits

1. **Immediate Response**: Ctrl+C now stops the application immediately
2. **Clean Shutdown**: Proper process termination prevents resource leaks
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Error Handling**: Includes proper error handling and status messages
5. **Environment Checks**: Validates Python installation and dependencies

### Technical Details

- **Signal Handling**: Uses Python's `signal` module to catch interrupts
- **Process Control**: Uses `subprocess.Popen` for better process management
- **Timeout Handling**: Implements graceful shutdown with fallback to force termination
- **Environment Variables**: Sets Streamlit configuration for better behavior

### Fallback

If you prefer to use the original method, you can still run:
```bash
streamlit run app/ui/app.py
```

However, this method may not respond immediately to Ctrl+C.

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Run the application using the new launcher
2. Wait for Streamlit to start and open in your browser
3. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
4. The application should stop immediately with a "Application stopped" message

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Permission Errors (Unix/Linux)**: Make the shell script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start_app.sh
   ```

2. **Python Not Found**: Ensure Python is installed and in your PATH

3. **Module Import Errors**: Activate your virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Port Already in Use**: If Streamlit fails to start, another instance might be running. Kill any existing Streamlit processes and try again.
