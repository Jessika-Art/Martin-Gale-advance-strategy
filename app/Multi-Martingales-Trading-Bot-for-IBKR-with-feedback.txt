                                                   The feedback and addition/ modification
The Risk Management section should be removed, as it duplicates and conflicts with each strategy's built-in limits (max order sizes, position caps, drawdown guardrails, etc.). For example, if you cap drawdown mid-cycle, the bot will stop at a fixed leg-even if the market reverses-locking in larger losses and breaking the strategy's flow. Allocation sizing is already handled by each strategy's parameters, so the entire risk block just adds confusion.
Instead, create a single Shared Settings section for parameters common to all strategies (as explained in the document). Centralising these defaults avoids duplication and makes updates far simpler.
Remove the arbitrary 50% cap on distance values, and lift any hard limits on take-profit or stop-loss levels. This lets the bot support "buy & hold" exits (e.g. 300% gains) and long-term dollar-cost averaging (holding through 100%+ drawdowns), since our goal is both active trading and portfolio management.
Position sizing should sometimes start with a fixed and the smallest possible initial order, then grow dynamically based on portfolio targets, not as a flat percentage. If you begin with a large first lot and use tight distance percentages (e.g. in WDM, CDM, leveraged ETFs like TQQQ, or ZRM in sideways markets) this inherently includes high exposure to high risk; thus, the bot can open too many positions and dangerously amplify exposure. In contrast, for long-term strategies with wide distance levels, dynamic initial sizing works safely. and the parameters provided in the document(MM profit reinvestment plan), tying each increase to specific portfolio growth goals-rather than blindly matching growth percentages-lets us control both when and by how much the first position grows.
and also remove the position cap for orders levels, to be unlimited values entry possibility to set the parameters, either as us dollar (fractional shares) or full share numbers(not a percentage), so it should have to entry values options full share /USD fractional shares for positions sizes and should not be linked to portfolio if the reinvestment management plan is off.
Finally, urgently, before anything, to progress and verify any next modification and addition to the bot, the backtest must include a Detailed Cycle Analysis: a per-trade log of open/close dates, prices, sizes, and P/L. Without that granular insight, we can't diagnose execution errors or verify the bot's behaviour across market conditions.
Note that all the work is left for us to add to the application interface is coloured red in the document. we need to expand the deadline until the work is finished and tested.














Multi-Martingales Trading Bot for IBKR
 
1. Introduction
Build a fully automated trading bot on the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API that runs up to four mirrored martingale-based strategies:
* Counter Direction Martingale (CDM): Buys more as price falls, exiting on recovery. Or sell as the price increases and exit on rebound.
* With Direction Martingale (WDM): Buy more as the price rises, exiting on a retrace. Or sell as the price falls, exiting on the price rebound.
* Zone Recovery Martingale (ZRM): Opens positions within a defined price zone boundary, exiting on zone exit by TP distance fixed.
* Inverse Zone Recovery Martingale (IZRM): This is similar to ZRM, but it opens the sell orders on the upper side, buys on the lower side, and exits by SL.
All parameter blocks for CDM & WDM are mirrored for ZRM & IZRM, with identical setting names prefixed by ZRM_ and IZRM. And there is a shared settings section that includes settings that apply to all strategies.


2. Strategy Modes & SubModes

ModeDescriptionCDM OnlyRun only the CounterDirection martingale.WDM OnlyRun only the WithDirection martingale.ZRM OnlyRun only the Zone Recovery martingale.IZRM OnlyRun only the Inverse Zone Recovery martingale.MultipleRun any combination of strategies together.When Multiple is selected:
* Parallel: All selected strategies open their initial trade simultaneously.
* Sequential: Open the first trade of a primary strategy; subsequent triggers follow individual sub-mode logic to branch among the selected strategies.

Important settings notes: the TP and SL, and trailing are always set for the last position, and all previous ones are ignored when opening a new position. 
distances and sizes are computed relative to the previous position only not all positions opened previously. And each of these is to be et for up to 50 legs separated by a comma in a line input, such as from the first 10 positions sl is(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2) and all distances sl, tp, trailing can accept entry the full number and partial and all these are percentage numbers to be read by the bot exmaple 1.30 is 1.30%. 
When the max order is reached, the bot leaves all open positions open until reaching an exit rule.
When some settings are colored the same colour, it means they are overlapped and each is to be set if an overlap function is on, for example, trailing and using another strategy as entry index.

4. Execution Flow
1. Initialise:
o Load all shared and per-strategy parameters (CDM, WDM, ZRM, IZRM).
o Allocate capital and position sizing to each enabled strategy based on capital allocation and reinvestment settings.
2. Entry:
o Evaluate Strategy combination Mode and Sub Mode (Parallel/Sequential).
o For each strategy that is turned on:
* CDM: Open the first long position when the price drops to the DM Price Trigger.
* WDM: Open the first long position when the price rises to the WDM Price Trigger.
* ZRM: Open the first position at ZRM Zone Centre Price, then wait for the zone-boundary touch to trigger further legs.
* IZRM: Open the first position at IZRM Zone Centre Price, then wait for the zone-boundary touch to trigger further legs.
o In Parallel, all initial trades fire at once; in Sequential, only the primary strategy starts, and others await their triggers.
3. Martingale Legs:
o Each enabled strategy monitors its specific trigger to add incremental legs up to Max Orders:
* CDM: On each additional price drop by CDM Order Distances, place another buy leg.
* WDM: On each additional price rise by WDM Order Distances, place another buy leg.
* ZRM: On each touch of a zone boundary (upper or lower) as defined by ZRM SETTINGS, place the next leg at the specified ZRM Order Distances from that boundary.
* IZRM: On each touch of a zone boundary (upper or lower) as defined by IZRM Zone Width Pct, place the next leg at the specified IZRM Order Distances from that boundary.
o Respect Hold Previous: decide whether to leave existing legs open or closed before placing a new one.
4. Exit:
o Each strategy applies its exit logic independently:
* CDM: Close all legs when the price recovers to any leg's CDM Order TPs.
* WDM: Close all legs when price retraces to their WDM Order SLs or hits WDM Order TPs after meeting Min Legs Before Exit.
* ZRM: Close legs when price re-enters the defined zone and hits ZRM Order TPs.
* IZRM: Close legs when price re-enters the defined zone and hits ZRM Order TPs.
o Exit by trailing stop: apply trailing stops per strategy if trailing stops are enabled and apply to this strategy(ZRM and CDM).
5. Repeat/Shutdown:
o If Repeat on Close is enabled, once all active strategies have closed positions, loop back to Entry.
o Otherwise, cease trading until manually restarted or the show backtest concludes.

5. Usage Scenarios
Below are four common execution scenarios illustrating how the bot behaves under different StrategyMode and SubMode settings.
5.1 CDM Only 
* Mode: StrategyMode = CDM (first order buy selected scenario)
* Flow:
1. Place an initial buy at the market/limit price.
2. On each price drop = CDM_DropPct, open the next leg sized by CDM_sizes.
3. Keep or close prior legs per CDM_HoldPrevious.
4. When price recovers to CDM_RecoveryTarget(tp), close all legs.
5. If CDM_RepeatOnClose, restart cycle automatically.

5.2 WDM Only
* Mode: StrategyMode = WDM (first order buy selected scenario)
* Flow:
1. Place an initial buy.
2. On each price rise = WDM_RisePct, open the next leg sized by WDM_sizes.
3. Keep or close prior legs per WDM_HoldPrevious.
4. After at least one leg is profitable, if the price retraces by = WDM_StopLossPct from its peak, close all legs.
5. If WDM_RepeatOnProfit, restart cycle.


* 5.3 Both - Parallel (first order buy selected scenario)
* Mode: StrategyMode = Both, SubMode = Parallel
* Flow:
1. Simultaneously place CDM and WDM initial buy orders.
2. Each strategy independently monitors its trigger thresholds and opens martingale legs in parallel.
3. Each strategy exits on its own rule (recovery target or stop-loss retrace).
4. Optionally, closing one side can trigger the other if a global flag is set.
5. Each side may restart independently per its repeat setting if the restart option is set.

* 5.4 Both - Sequential(first order buy selected scenario)
* Mode: StrategyMode = Both, SubMode = Sequential
* Configuration: Define PrimaryStrategy = CDM or WDM. The very first order (always a Buy) is called the  Initial Order, and both strategies refer to it as their starting leg.
* Second-Order Distance: Configure the primary strategy' second position distance from the first position as a shared percentage distance (e.g. 1%) from the Initial Order at which the bot decides which martingale branch to follow next, which is set within a first order distance, in each strategy distance setting.
Flow:
1. Place the Initial Order (Buy) of size InitialSize.
2. Wait for the price move of ±SecondOrderDistance from the executed price. Here, we have two scenarios:
Scenario A: Price ? by SecondOrderDistance:
* The first initial trade is in profit.
* Trigger WDM: Place the next WDM leg at EntryPrice * (1 + WDM_RisePct) with size InitialSize * WDM_sizes[1].
* Continue opening further WDM legs on each additional rise of WDM_RisePct, per configuration.

Scenario B: Price ? by SecondOrderDistance
o The first initial trade is at a loss.
o Trigger CDM: Place the next CDM leg at EntryPrice * (1 - CDM_DropPct) with size InitialSize * CDM_sizes[1].
o Continue opening further CDM legs on each additional drop of CDM_DropPct, per configuration.


3. Post-Trigger Operations
o From the triggered branch onward, follow that strategy's full martingale logic (additional legs, exit rules, repeat settings). 
o The non-triggered strategy remains idle until the next primary reset (if at all).

4. Exit & Repeat 
o Each strategy exiting on its own exit rule (recovery target or stop-loss retrace).
o If repeat flags are set, the bot resets the first Initial Order and repeats the sequential decision process.
This sequential design ensures a single initial buy is leveraged by either the trend-following (WDM) branch when profitable or the mean-reversion (CDM) branch when adverse.


* 5.5 ZRM Only Workflow(first order sell selected scenario)
1. Initialise: Load ZRM zone parameters (ZRM Zone Centre Price, ZRM Zone Width Pct) and allocate capital.
2. Entry: Place the initial order at the first ZRM Zone Price level( when zone mode is started).
3. Legs: On each touch of the lower or upper zone boundary (start ± width), place the next leg at the configured ZRM Order Distances from that touched boundary, up to ZRM Max Orders.
4. Exit: When price re-enters the zone and hits any leg's ZRM Order TPs, close all ZRM positions, or individually if ZRM Hold Previous is false.
5. Repeat: Restart if Repeat on Close is enabled.


5.6 IZRM Only Workflow (first order buy selected scenario)
1. Initialise: Load IZRM zone parameters (IZRM Zone start Price) and allocate capital.
2. Entry: Wait for price to break out beyond the upper or lower zone boundary (start ± width), then open initial leg in direction of breakout.
3. Legs: On each touch of the lower or upper zone boundary (start ± width), place the next leg at the configured IZRM Order Distances from that touched boundary, up to IZRM Max Orders.
4. Exit: When price reverses back into the zone and hits any leg's IZRM Order SLs, close all IZRM positions, or individually if IZRM Hold Previous is false.
5. Repeat: Restart if Repeat on Close is enabled. 



Cycle-Focused Backtest Report with Trade Log and Evaluation Ratios
1. Cycle Overview
* Cycle Definition:
A cycle begins with the initial order entry and continues with subsequent position additions triggered by price declines until the recovery condition is met and all positions are closed. Each complete cycle is treated as an individual trade for performance analysis.
* Evaluation Period:
Example: January 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023
* Initial Capital:
Example: $100,000 allocated for backtesting

2. Cycle Metrics Summary
* Total Cycles Executed:
Number of complete cycles finished during the backtest period.
* Cycle Win Rate:
Percentage of cycles that closed with a profit.
* Average Cycle Profit/Loss:
Mean profit or loss per cycle (from initial entry to cycle closure).
* Maximum Cycle Profit / Loss:
The highest profit and the worst loss were recorded in a single cycle.
* Average Cycle Duration:
The mean time taken from the start to the closure of a cycle.
* Cycle Drawdown:
Maximum decline observed within a cycle from peak equity to the lowest point before recovery.

3. Evaluation Ratios
3.1. Risk/Reward Ratio
* Definition:
Ratio of the average profit from winning cycles to the average loss from losing cycles.
* Purpose:
Indicates the expected reward per unit of risk; a higher ratio suggests that winning cycles generate significantly more profit relative to the losses incurred.
3.2. Profit Factor
* Definition:
Ratio of the sum of profits from winning cycles to the sum of losses from losing cycles.
* Purpose:
Provides an overall view of profitability across cycles. A value above 1 signifies aggregate profitability.
3.3. Sharpe Ratio (Cycle-Based)
* Definition:
Average cycle return (more than a risk-free rate) divided by the standard deviation of cycle returns.
* Purpose:
Evaluates risk-adjusted performance. Higher values indicate that returns are efficiently generated relative to the risk taken.
3.4. Sortino Ratio
* Definition:
Cycle return above a minimum acceptable return divided by the downside deviation.
* Purpose:
Focuses solely on downside risk and is useful when the primary concern is mitigating losses.
3.5. Calmar Ratio
* Definition:
Ratio of average cycle profit to the maximum drawdown within cycles.
* Purpose:
Assesses how effectively the strategy manages drawdowns relative to profit. A higher value is indicative of better drawdown management.
3.6. Maximum Drawdown Ratio
* Definition:
Maximum drawdown as a percentage of the cycle's peak equity.
* Purpose:
Although not a ratio in the traditional sense, it offers a quick evaluation of risk by comparing the worst-case decline to cycle profits.
* 1. Operating Cycle Efficiency (OCE)
* Definition: Measures how efficiently each trading cycle converts capital into net profit.
* Formula (basic version):
OCE = Net Cycle Profit / Average Capital Deployed During Cycle
* Formula (time-adjusted version):
OCE = (Net Cycle Profit / Average Capital Deployed During Cycle) × (1 / Cycle Duration in Days)
* 
* 2. Return on Equity (ROE)
* Definition: Indicates how much profit is generated from the capital committed at the start of a cycle.
* Formula:
ROE = (Net Cycle Profit / Starting Capital of the Cycle) × 100%
* 
* 3. Average Unit Revenue (AUR)
* Definition: Shows the average profit made per unit traded during a cycle.
* Formula:
AUR = Total Cycle Profit / Total Number of Units Traded in the Cycle
* ?? 1. Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWR or TWRR)
* Definition: Measures performance by isolating the effect of trading decisions from the effect of capital inflows/outflows. Ideal for evaluating strategy, not cash timing.
* Formula (simplified for each cycle):
TWR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1 / Number of Periods)] - 1
* ? Why it's useful: It gives a pure view of strategy performance, unaffected by when money was added or withdrawn.
* 
* ?? 2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
* Definition: The interest rate at which the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (in/out during the cycle) equals zero.
* Formula:
Solve:
NPV = ? [Cash Flow_t / (1 + IRR)^t] = 0
* ? Why it's useful: IRR takes both the timing and amount of cash flows into account. It's powerful for evaluating money usage across long cycles with multiple entries.
* 
* ?? 3. Maximum Drawdown (MDD)
* Definition: Measures the largest peak-to-trough loss in capital during the cycle.
* Formula:
Max Drawdown = (Peak Capital - Lowest Capital) / Peak Capital
* ? Why it's useful: Shows how much risk was taken to earn returns - key for judging safety and resilience.
* 
* ?? 4. Recovery Factor
* Definition: Compares total profit to the max drawdown.
* Formula:
Recovery Factor = Net Cycle Profit / Maximum Drawdown
* ? Why it's useful: Evaluates how effectively losses were recovered.
* 
* ?? 5. Capital Efficiency Ratio (CER)
* Definition: Measures how much profit was generated per unit of capital deployed.
* Formula:
CER = Net Profit / Capital Exposure Time
* Where:
Capital Exposure Time = Capital Used × Number of Days in Use
* ? Why it's useful: Takes the time value of locked capital into account.
*
