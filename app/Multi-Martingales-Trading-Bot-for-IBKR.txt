                           Multi-Martingales Trading Bot for IBKR



                                            1. Introduction

Build a fully automated trading bot on the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API that runs up to four mirrored
martingale-based strategies:

        Counter Direction Martingale (CDM): Buys more as price falls, exiting on recovery. Or sell as the price
         increases and exit on rebound.
        With Direction Martingale (WDM): Buy more as the price rises, exiting on a retrace. Or sell as the
         price falls, exiting on the price rebound.
        Zone Recovery Martingale (ZRM): Opens positions within a defined price zone boundary, exiting on
         zone exit by TP distance fixed.
        Inverse Zone Recovery Martingale (IZRM): This is similar to ZRM, but it opens the sell orders on the
         upper side, buys on the lower side, and exits by SL.

All parameter blocks for CDM & WDM are mirrored for ZRM & IZRM, with identical setting names prefixed by
ZRM_ and IZRM. And there is a shared settings section that includes settings that apply to all strategies.




                                   2. Strategy Modes & SubModes


 Mode                                                      Description
 CDM Only                                                  Run only the CounterDirection martingale.
 WDM Only                                                  Run only the WithDirection martingale.
 ZRM Only                                                  Run only the Zone Recovery martingale.
 IZRM Only                                                 Run only the Inverse Zone Recovery martingale.
 Multiple                                                  Run any combination of strategies together.

When Multiple is selected:

        Parallel: All selected strategies open their initial trade simultaneously.
        Sequential: Open the first trade of a primary strategy; subsequent triggers follow individual sub-mode
         logic to branch among the selected strategies.

Important settings notes: the TP and SL, and trailing are always set for the last position, and all previous ones
are ignored when opening a new position.
distances and sizes are computed relative to the previous position only not all positions opened previously.
And each of these is to be et for up to 50 legs separated by a comma in a line input, such as from the first 10
positions sl is(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2) and all distances sl, tp, trailing can accept entry the full number and partial and
all these are percentage numbers to be read by the bot exmaple 1.30 is 1.30%.
When the max order is reached, the bot leaves all open positions open until reaching an exit rule.
When some settings are colored the same colour, it means they are overlapped and each is to be set if an
overlap function is on, for example, trailing and using another strategy as entry index.




                                               4. Execution Flow

    1.   Initialise:
               o Load all shared and per-strategy parameters (CDM, WDM, ZRM, IZRM).
               o Allocate capital and position sizing to each enabled strategy based on capital allocation and
                   reinvestment settings.
    2.   Entry:
               o Evaluate Strategy combination Mode and Sub Mode (Parallel/Sequential).
               o For each strategy that is turned on:
                        CDM: Open the first long position when the price drops to the DM Price Trigger.
                        WDM: Open the first long position when the price rises to the WDM Price Trigger.
                        ZRM: Open the first position at ZRM Zone Centre Price, then wait for the
                           zone-boundary touch to trigger further legs.
                        IZRM: Open the first position at IZRM Zone Centre Price, then wait for the
                           zone-boundary touch to trigger further legs.
               o In Parallel, all initial trades fire at once; in Sequential, only the primary strategy starts, and
                   others await their triggers.
    3.   Martingale Legs:
               o Each enabled strategy monitors its specific trigger to add incremental legs up to Max Orders:
                        CDM: On each additional price drop by CDM Order Distances, place another buy
                           leg.
                        WDM: On each additional price rise by WDM Order Distances, place another buy
                           leg.
                        ZRM: On each touch of a zone boundary (upper or lower) as defined by ZRM
                           SETTINGS, place the next leg at the specified ZRM Order Distances from that
                           boundary.
                        IZRM: On each touch of a zone boundary (upper or lower) as defined by IZRM Zone
                           Width Pct, place the next leg at the specified IZRM Order Distances from that
                           boundary.
               o Respect Hold Previous: decide whether to leave existing legs open or closed before placing a
                   new one.
    4.   Exit:


                                                            7
             o    Each strategy applies its exit logic independently:
                       CDM: Close all legs when the price recovers to any leg’s CDM Order TPs.
                       WDM: Close all legs when price retraces to their WDM Order SLs or hits WDM
                           Order TPs after meeting Min Legs Before Exit.
                       ZRM: Close legs when price re-enters the defined zone and hits ZRM Order TPs.
                       IZRM: Close legs when price re-enters the defined zone and hits ZRM Order TPs.

    o    Exit by trailing stop: apply trailing stops per strategy if trailing stops are enabled and apply to this
         strategy(ZRM and CDM).

    5.   Repeat/Shutdown:
            o If Repeat on Close is enabled, once all active strategies have closed positions, loop back to
                Entry.
            o Otherwise, cease trading until manually restarted or the show backtest concludes.




                                     5. Usage Scenarios

Below are four common execution scenarios illustrating how the bot behaves under different StrategyMode
and SubMode settings.

5.1 CDM Only

                 Mode: StrategyMode = CDM (first order buy selected scenario)
                 Flow:
                      1. Place an initial buy at the market/limit price.
                      2. On each price drop ≥ CDM_DropPct, open the next leg sized by CDM_sizes.
                      3. Keep or close prior legs per CDM_HoldPrevious.
                      4. When price recovers to CDM_RecoveryTarget(tp), close all legs.
                      5. If CDM_RepeatOnClose, restart cycle automatically.




5.2 WDM Only

                 Mode: StrategyMode = WDM (first order buy selected scenario)

                 Flow:
                      1.    Place an initial buy.
                      2.    On each price rise ≥ WDM_RisePct, open the next leg sized by WDM_sizes.
                      3.    Keep or close prior legs per WDM_HoldPrevious.
                      4.    After at least one leg is profitable, if the price retraces by ≥ WDM_StopLossPct from
                            its peak, close all legs.
                       5.   If WDM_RepeatOnProfit, restart cycle.

   5.3 Both — Parallel (first order buy selected scenario)

            Mode: StrategyMode = Both, SubMode = Parallel
            Flow:
                 1. Simultaneously place CDM and WDM initial buy orders.
                 2. Each strategy independently monitors its trigger thresholds and opens martingale
                     legs in parallel.
                 3. Each strategy exits on its own rule (recovery target or stop-loss retrace).
                 4. Optionally, closing one side can trigger the other if a global flag is set.
                 5. Each side may restart independently per its repeat setting if the restart option is set.




   5.4 Both — Sequential(first order buy selected scenario)

            Mode: StrategyMode = Both, SubMode = Sequential
            Configuration: Define PrimaryStrategy = CDM or WDM. The very first order (always a Buy) is
             called the Initial Order, and both strategies refer to it as their starting leg.
            Second-Order Distance: Configure the primary strategy’ second position distance from the
             first position as a shared percentage distance (e.g. 1%) from the Initial Order at which the bot
             decides which martingale branch to follow next, which is set within a first order distance, in
             each strategy distance setting.

             Flow:

        1.   Place the Initial Order (Buy) of size InitialSize.
        2.   Wait for the price move of ±SecondOrderDistance from the executed price. Here, we have
             two scenarios:

                 Scenario A: Price ↑ by SecondOrderDistance:



                                                   9
                      The first initial trade is in profit.
                      Trigger WDM: Place the next WDM leg at EntryPrice * (1 + WDM_RisePct) with size
                       InitialSize * WDM_sizes[1].
                      Continue opening further WDM legs on each additional rise of WDM_RisePct, per
                       configuration.




Scenario B: Price ↓ by SecondOrderDistance

             o    The first initial trade is at a loss.
             o    Trigger CDM: Place the next CDM leg at EntryPrice * (1 - CDM_DropPct) with size InitialSize *
                  CDM_sizes[1].
             o    Continue opening further CDM legs on each additional drop of CDM_DropPct, per
                  configuration.




    3.   Post-Trigger Operations

    o    From the triggered branch onward, follow that strategy’s full martingale logic (additional legs, exit
         rules, repeat settings).
    o    The non-triggered strategy remains idle until the next primary reset (if at all).




    4.   Exit & Repeat

    o    Each strategy exiting on its own exit rule (recovery target or stop-loss retrace).
    o    If repeat flags are set, the bot resets the first Initial Order and repeats the sequential decision process.


                                                        10
This sequential design ensures a single initial buy is leveraged by either the trend-following (WDM) branch
when profitable or the mean-reversion (CDM) branch when adverse.




        5.5 ZRM Only Workflow(first order sell selected scenario)

    1.   Initialise: Load ZRM zone parameters (ZRM Zone Centre Price, ZRM Zone Width Pct) and allocate
         capital.
    2.   Entry: Place the initial order at the first ZRM Zone Price level( when zone mode is started).
    3.   Legs: On each touch of the lower or upper zone boundary (start ± width), place the next leg at the
         configured ZRM Order Distances from that touched boundary, up to ZRM Max Orders.
    4.   Exit: When price re-enters the zone and hits any leg’s ZRM Order TPs, close all ZRM positions, or
         individually if ZRM Hold Previous is false.
    5.   Repeat: Restart if Repeat on Close is enabled.




5.6 IZRM Only Workflow (first order buy selected scenario)

    1.   Initialise: Load IZRM zone parameters (IZRM Zone start Price) and allocate capital.
    2.   Entry: Wait for price to break out beyond the upper or lower zone boundary (start ± width), then
         open initial leg in direction of breakout.
    3.   Legs: On each touch of the lower or upper zone boundary (start ± width), place the next leg at the
         configured IZRM Order Distances from that touched boundary, up to IZRM Max Orders.
    4.   Exit: When price reverses back into the zone and hits any leg’s IZRM Order SLs, close all IZRM
         positions, or individually if IZRM Hold Previous is false.
    5.   Repeat: Restart if Repeat on Close is enabled.

Cycle-Focused Backtest Report with Trade
Log and Evaluation Ratios
1. Cycle Overview
           Cycle Definition:
            A cycle begins with the initial order entry and continues with subsequent
            position additions triggered by price declines until the recovery condition is
            met and all positions are closed. Each complete cycle is treated as an
            individual trade for performance analysis.
           Evaluation Period:
            Example: January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023
           Initial Capital:
            Example: $100,000 allocated for backtesting




2. Cycle Metrics Summary
           Total Cycles Executed:
            Number of complete cycles finished during the backtest period.
           Cycle Win Rate:
            Percentage of cycles that closed with a profit.
           Average Cycle Profit/Loss:
            Mean profit or loss per cycle (from initial entry to cycle closure).
           Maximum Cycle Profit / Loss:
            The highest profit and the worst loss were recorded in a single cycle.
           Average Cycle Duration:
            The mean time taken from the start to the closure of a cycle.
           Cycle Drawdown:
            Maximum decline observed within a cycle from peak equity to the lowest
            point before recovery.




3. Evaluation Ratios
3.1. Risk/Reward Ratio

           Definition:
            Ratio of the average profit from winning cycles to the average loss from losing
            cycles.


                                           12
            Purpose:
             Indicates the expected reward per unit of risk; a higher ratio suggests that
             winning cycles generate significantly more profit relative to the losses
             incurred.

3.2. Profit Factor

            Definition:
             Ratio of the sum of profits from winning cycles to the sum of losses from
             losing cycles.
            Purpose:
             Provides an overall view of profitability across cycles. A value above 1
             signifies aggregate profitability.

3.3. Sharpe Ratio (Cycle-Based)

            Definition:
             Average cycle return (more than a risk-free rate) divided by the standard
             deviation of cycle returns.
            Purpose:
             Evaluates risk-adjusted performance. Higher values indicate that returns are
             efficiently generated relative to the risk taken.

3.4. Sortino Ratio

            Definition:
             Cycle return above a minimum acceptable return divided by the downside
             deviation.
            Purpose:
             Focuses solely on downside risk and is useful when the primary concern is
             mitigating losses.

3.5. Calmar Ratio

            Definition:
             Ratio of average cycle profit to the maximum drawdown within cycles.
            Purpose:
             Assesses how effectively the strategy manages drawdowns relative to profit. A
             higher value is indicative of better drawdown management.

3.6. Maximum Drawdown Ratio

            Definition:
             Maximum drawdown as a percentage of the cycle’s peak equity.
            Purpose:
             Although not a ratio in the traditional sense, it offers a quick evaluation of risk
             by comparing the worst-case decline to cycle profits.
      1. Operating Cycle Efficiency (OCE)


                                             13
   Definition: Measures how efficiently each trading cycle converts capital into net
    profit.
   Formula (basic version):
    OCE = Net Cycle Profit / Average Capital Deployed During Cycle
   Formula (time-adjusted version):
    OCE = (Net Cycle Profit / Average Capital Deployed During Cycle) × (1
    / Cycle Duration in Days)

   2. Return on Equity (ROE)
   Definition: Indicates how much profit is generated from the capital committed at the
    start of a cycle.
   Formula:
    ROE = (Net Cycle Profit / Starting Capital of the Cycle) × 100%

   3. Average Unit Revenue (AUR)
   Definition: Shows the average profit made per unit traded during a cycle.
   Formula:
    AUR = Total Cycle Profit / Total Number of Units Traded in the Cycle
   🔁 1. Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWR or TWRR)
   Definition: Measures performance by isolating the effect of trading decisions from
    the effect of capital inflows/outflows. Ideal for evaluating strategy, not cash timing.
   Formula (simplified for each cycle):
    TWR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1 / Number of Periods)] -
    1
   ✅ Why it’s useful: It gives a pure view of strategy performance, unaffected by
    when money was added or withdrawn.

   💰 2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
   Definition: The interest rate at which the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows
    (in/out during the cycle) equals zero.
   Formula:
    Solve:
    NPV = ∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + IRR)^t] = 0
   ✅ Why it’s useful: IRR takes both the timing and amount of cash flows into
    account. It's powerful for evaluating money usage across long cycles with multiple
    entries.

   📉 3. Maximum Drawdown (MDD)
   Definition: Measures the largest peak-to-trough loss in capital during the cycle.
   Formula:
    Max Drawdown = (Peak Capital - Lowest Capital) / Peak Capital
   ✅ Why it’s useful: Shows how much risk was taken to earn returns — key for
    judging safety and resilience.

   ⏱️ 4. Recovery Factor
   Definition: Compares total profit to the max drawdown.
   Formula:
    Recovery Factor = Net Cycle Profit / Maximum Drawdown
   ✅ Why it’s useful: Evaluates how effectively losses were recovered.



                                           14
         🧮 5. Capital Efficiency Ratio (CER)
         Definition: Measures how much profit was generated per unit of capital deployed.
         Formula:
          CER = Net Profit / Capital Exposure Time
         Where:
          Capital Exposure Time = Capital Used × Number of Days in Use
         ✅ Why it’s useful: Takes the time value of locked capital into account.
