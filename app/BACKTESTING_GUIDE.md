## üìä Understanding Results

### Key Performance Metrics

#### Return Metrics
- **Total Return**: Overall percentage gain/loss
- **Annual Return**: Annualized return percentage
- **Buy & Hold Return**: Comparison to simply buying and holding

#### Risk Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return (higher is better)
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk-adjusted return
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline

#### Trade Metrics
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Average Trade**: Average return per trade
- **Number of Trades**: Total trades executed

### Interpreting Results

#### Good Performance Indicators
- **Sharpe Ratio > 1.0**: Indicates good risk-adjusted returns
- **Win Rate > 50%**: More winning trades than losing trades
- **Profit Factor > 1.5**: Strong profitability relative to losses
- **Max Drawdown < 20%**: Reasonable risk management

#### Warning Signs
- **Sharpe Ratio < 0.5**: Poor risk-adjusted performance
- **Win Rate < 40%**: Too many losing trades
- **Profit Factor < 1.0**: Strategy loses money overall
- **Max Drawdown > 30%**: High risk of significant losses

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Insufficient Data" Error
- **Cause**: Not enough historical data points
- **Solution**: 
  - Use a longer date range
  - Choose a more liquid symbol
  - Select a longer timeframe (e.g., 1d instead of 1m)

#### "Invalid Price Data" Error
- **Cause**: Data contains zero or negative prices
- **Solution**:
  - Verify the ticker symbol is correct
  - Try a different date range
  - Use a major stock symbol for testing

#### Chart Generation Errors
- **Cause**: Upsampling issues with certain data
- **Solution**: The system automatically provides fallback charts
- **Alternative**: Try different timeframes or date ranges

#### Slow Performance
- **Cause**: Large datasets or complex strategies
- **Solution**:
  - Use shorter date ranges for initial testing
  - Start with single strategies before combining
  - Use longer timeframes (1h, 4h, 1d)

### Data Quality Tips

#### Best Practices
- **Use Major Symbols**: Start with liquid stocks (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- **Reasonable Date Ranges**: 3-12 months for initial testing
- **Appropriate Timeframes**: 1h-1d for most strategies
- **Sufficient Data**: Ensure at least 100+ data points

#### Timeframe Recommendations
- **Intraday Strategies**: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m
- **Swing Trading**: 1h, 4h
- **Position Trading**: 1d, 1wk
- **Long-term Analysis**: 1wk, 1mo
